# RFID System - IoT project

This is a project to-be implemented on an Raspberry Pi system on Internet of Things course. The idea is having a server (on Raspberry itself
or on a PC) and a Raspberry client equipped with RFID scanner. The system is supposed to be keeping track of workers that check in and out
with their unique RFID tags.

### Requirements for the system:
- multiple clients,
- adding and removing clients,
- asigning and removing RFID cards from workers,
- keeping track of when and on which terminal was a tag scanned along with its ID (whether a worker checked in, out or the ID was unknown)
- generating reports of worker's worktime.
